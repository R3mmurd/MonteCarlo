# Monte Carlo

Some basic problem solutions by using Monte Carlo method.

- MC_integration.H contains a generic Monte Carlo algorithm to compute the
  definite integral of a function.

- MC_integration.C contains a program to compute the integral between 0 and 2
  to the function e^(-x^2).


- MC_pi.C contains a program with the classical example of Monte Carlo method
  for computing the value of PI.

- MC_spheres.C contains a program that uses the Monte Carlo method in order to
  compute the volume of a set of spheres and the overlapping volume between
  them.

- spheres.txt the definitions of some spheres for MC_spheres.C
